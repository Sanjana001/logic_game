This is a small project which is basically a small logic game.
In our childhood we play some brain games in which we choose a number and then perform some calculations in our mind and then came to as surprise when the other person told us our answer. We all know that actually there is a logic behind that game.
So from those games I have tried to make one of those small game which we were played in our childhood.
