This is a small project which is basically a small logic game.
In our childhood we play some brain games in which we chose a number and then performed some calculations in our mind and then we were surprised when the other person told us our answer. But today we all know that actually there is a logic behind that game.
So from those games I have tried to make one of those small games which we were played in our childhood.
The following code will only give you the instructions and you have to follow that instructions and perform calculations according to that and in the final it will tell you yours answer.
